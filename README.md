# Cardiac_Timing_Memory

This set of experiments look into how memory can be influenced by the interoceptive context (i.e., by cardiac timing) during encoding and retrieval.

The experiment was coded in Matlab. The scripts incorporated the SHIMMER device for ECG, EDA, and behavioral recording.

Data analysis focusing on signal detection theory was done in R. 

The running protocol for participant recruitment and experimental details is also included.
